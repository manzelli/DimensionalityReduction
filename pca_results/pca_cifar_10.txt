pca_cifar_10.py:23: UserWarning: 
This call to matplotlib.use() has no effect because the backend has already
been chosen; matplotlib.use() must be called *before* pylab, matplotlib.pyplot,
or matplotlib.backends is imported for the first time.

The backend was *originally* set to 'TkAgg' by the following code:
  File "pca_cifar_10.py", line 5, in <module>
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py", line 71, in <module>
    from matplotlib.backends import pylab_setup
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/matplotlib/backends/__init__.py", line 16, in <module>
    line for line in traceback.format_stack()


  matplotlib.use('Agg')
